### How It Works
  1. The user signs up or logs in to access the application.
  2. A typing mode is selected based on the user’s skill level.
  3. A random sentence is displayed, and the timer starts when typing begins.
  4. User input is validated in real time to calculate speed and accuracy.
  5. Results are shown when the timer ends or when the user stops the session.
  6. The user can restart, switch modes, or continue practicing to improve performance.
